# Project Module

## Description

The goal of this directory structure is to break the functionalities of the
project into modules.  Each module has all the necessary files to function
independently and can be called from other parts of the code, for example from
/app.

## Points of Note

- Change module_name to be consistent with the module functionality
- Duplicate the structure of module_name to add additional modules
- The expectation is for any file inside the modules folder to be called from /app
